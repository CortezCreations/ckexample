 Example plugin setup to showcase my coding style with some common core functionality I tend to utilize. 
 
 Notes :
 1. Was playing with React for a settings page setup. That part of things is pretty newbie and by no means polished. Using wp-scripts to load so need to play around with plugin structure using the build directory.
 2. Webhook services is just stubbed out not tested as of yet.
